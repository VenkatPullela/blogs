## Flow Switching, Caching, Aging and Tracking
Flows are in fasion again. First L3 swicthes were flow based. Then ASICs started building full fledged routing tables that allowed them scale. FLow retaed functions moved out of switches in to middle boxes with emergence of Network Processors. With recent advances in smart NICs and emergence of DPUs, IPUs flows are again taking the center stage. Programmability and P4 are also adding lot of new and interesting possibilities. 

This blog is a journey down the memory lane to review the history of Flows.
