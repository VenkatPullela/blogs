# Hardware implementation of flow tables
Hardware based tableimplementations were in use even from L2 switching days, with MAC-VLAN lookups 
in a CAM (Content Addressable Memories). Typically these were hardware implementations of a Hash table. Flow tables started with similar hashing techniques. 
Hashing tables came with the typical problems of collisions, lower utilization etc. Handling these hash collisions is harder in hardware implementations as they may require 
additional memory accesses, thus affecting uniform performance. In heneral, pipeline designs are difficult when there are variable number of operations involved. 
Customers usually look for a 99% guarantee or more hit percentage in the tables for deterministic capacity planning. This meant, utilization could be as low as 25% of
 the flow table.
